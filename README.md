# Whether to unit-test and/or end-to-end test
This app is based on [Getting Started with Angular: Your First App](https://angular.io/start). 
Few changes are introduced to add element selectors. 
Getting started instructions found [here](https://github.com/xgirma/unit-vs-e2e/blob/master/docs/getting.started.md). 
If you encounter errors look [here](https://github.com/xgirma/unit-vs-e2e/blob/master/docs/google.is.your.friend.md) or 
create an issue with this [template](https://github.com/xgirma/unit-vs-e2e/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

## Testing Pyramid

Which testing approach? a, b, or c.

    a. pyramid 
    b. test.allTheThings()
    c. cone

test.allTheThings()<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

## Background
[Your First App](https://angular.io/start) is a small Angular application containing the four pages, shown below.

<img width="1179" alt="Screen Shot 2019-11-11 at 12 48 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5876481/68563873-0274e780-041d-11ea-9876-6d39dc5f3f2e.png">

Products page display list of products. 
Details page display product details. 
Cart page display items added to the cart. 
Shipping page shows shipping options.  

The goal is to attempt to get near-full unit- and e2e-test coverage for each of the pages. 
On doing so document which testing pyramid is viable for the app.

## Limitations
Only a single front-end framework [Angular](https://angular.io) and a single integration test framework [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) is used. Testability varies from one framework to another. Using different frameworks may or may not present a different result.<sup id="a1">[2](#f1)</sup>
   
What is a unit of software-code is arguable. 

Intuitively, we use Angular's classification of application modules; and have seven-unit of applications (six components and one service) to experiment. For clarity and time, we ignore other parts of the application. 

The tests are executed using: OS X Catalina 10.15.1, Mac mini (2018), Processor: 3 GHz 6-Core, Intel Core i5, Memory: 8 GB 2667 MHz DDR4, WebStorm: 2019.2.3, and Chrome Browser (incognito) 78.0.3904.
